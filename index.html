  <h2>Who is Charlie Rusch? Short background of my life</h2>
	<p>Hi there! My name is Charlie Rusch and I am a senior majoring in economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.<p>
	<p>I grew up in Whitefish Bay Wisconsin, a suburb just north of downtown Milwaukee. I have always been an avid fan of the Bucks, Brewers, and Packers, so that is what I have decided to base this website around. If you would like some more information about where my hometown, use this link: <a href="https://www.wfbvillage.org">https://www.wfbvillage.org</a></p>

  <h2>This Website is all about Wisconsin Professional Sports, so what exactly can you expect to find?</h2>
