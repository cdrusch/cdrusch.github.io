  <h1>Let's Predict the rest of the Green Bay Packer's Season</h1>

  <h2>Who are the 2020 Green Bay Packers</h2>
	<p>So far in the 2020 NFL season, the Green Bay Packers sit atop the NFC North Division with a record of 6-2. A record like this puts the Packers at the top of the Conference with other impressive teams like the Seahawks, Saints, and Bucs. Additionally, after a few down years, Aaron Rodgers, the Packer's quarterback, has seemed to play up to the standard that NFL fans worldwide know that Rodgers is capable of. He has firmly supplanted himself in the League MVP discussion, with the help of wide receiver Davante Adams and running back Aaron Jones. In short, up to this point, the Packers have had a very successful season.<p>

  <h2>Win/Loss Predictions for the Packers (Rest of Season)</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Week 10: Packers vs. Jaguars (Win)</li>
	  <li>Week 11: Packers vs. Colts (Win)</li>
	  <li>Week 12: Packers vs. Bears (Loss)</li>
	  <li>Week 13: Packers vs. Eagles (Win)</li>
	  <li>Week 14: Packers vs. Lions (Win)</li>
	  <li>Week 15: Packers vs. Panthers (Win)</li>
	  <li>Week 16: Packers vs. Titans (Loss)</li>
	  <li>Week 17: Packers vs. Bears (Win)</li>
	  <li>Playoffs: I predict that the Packers will get to the NFC Championship, but face a similar fate as last season. They will go down in a hard-fought game to the Seattle Seahawks. The Packers defense is too shaky for them to be Super Bowl Champions in my opinion.</li>
