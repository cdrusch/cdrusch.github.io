  <h1>How can we fix the Milwaukee Brewers??</h1>

  <h2>What went wrong in 2020?</h2>
	<p>The 2020 Brewers season was a disappointment of sorts. No one projected them to be a title favorite at the beginning of the season, but compared to the 2018 and 2019 seasons, I think many people had high hopes. All season long, however, it felt as though the Brewers were alternating wins and losses. They were never able to pull together a win streak, even though they had some of the best pitching in the league. So, what went wrong?<p>
	<p>In my eyes a few things doomed the Brewers this season. For starters, their best player and one of the best hitters in the league, Christian Yelich, struggled all season. Yelich was so relied upon to deliver offense for the Brewers that his season long slump really put the team in a whole. Another reason that the Brewers were not more successful was the lack of team offense as a whole. The Brewers had a historically bad offense. No one was able to hit the ball with any sorts of consistency. Lastly, the Brewers lost key pieces. Players such as Mike Moustakas, Trent Grisham and Yasmani Grandal all left the Brewers for new homes after the 2019 season. This proved to be a devastating blow. So, with all of this being said, how can the team be fixed?</p>

  <h2>These are a few ideas that I have to fix the Brewers</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>They have to get Christian Yelich back into form</li>
	  <li>Relief Pitcher Devin Williams won NL Rookie Of the Year. The Brewers are deep at the pitching position. Perhaps they could use some of that talent to trade for some offensive talent</li>
	  <li>Play less "Money Ball". The Brewers GM David Stearns let multiple good hitters walk in free agency due to their high price tags. To an extent this works, but they cannot afford to just not pay their guys and gamble on young and inexperienced players.</li>
	</ul>
