  <h1>Ranking The Best Players on the Milwaukee Bucks from the 2019-2020 Season!</h1>

  <h2>My initial thoughts</h2>
	<p>As a self-proclaimed Milwaukee Bucks super-fan, I spend a lot of time watching any Bucks fan that I can when I have the chance. This past season was one that was full of promise and success... until the Covid-19 pandemic hit. With that being said, I want to rank how I viewed the players in terms of their importance to the team.<p>
